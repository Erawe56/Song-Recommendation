# Song-Recommendation

In the Song-Recommendation Project using neural networks, data sourced from Kaggle includes key columns such as song name, artist, popularity metrics, and lyrics. This dataset forms the basis for training the neural network model, which learns intricate patterns between these features to generate accurate song recommendations.Advanced techniques such as generative AI are employed to enrich the recommendation process.  

After training, the model is deployed using Streamlit, enabling users to interactively input their preferences based on these attributes. This approach not only enhances music discovery but also showcases the application of AI in personalized content recommendation systems, leveraging rich datasets for effective user engagement.
